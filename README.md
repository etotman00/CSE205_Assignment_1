# CSE205_Assignment_1
First assignment for CSE 205 - Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures

This assignment was developed using Eclipse IDE for Java Developers to create a Java program that prints out an invoice receipt of a consessions stand at a sports venue. The invoice gets printed from either:
- The order is manually done in person (selecting items via IDE console when program is executed)
- The order is received from a text file that contains the items that the customer wants. The program will then process the text file and will store the item names in the invoices.
